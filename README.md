# My first project on GitHub
Hey my name is *Yana Tkachenko*

_**I'm junior web designer**_

I like creating visually appealing websites, experimenting with design elements, and learning new skills to improve user experience. I enjoy collaborating with developers and other designers to bring ideas to life and staying updated with the latest design trends.

Here are some cool things I like to do as a junior web designer:

* Experiment with color palettes
* Create mockups in Figma or Adobe XD
* Learn HTML and CSS
* Explore UX/UI principles
* Follow design trends
* Build personal projects
* Collaborate with others
